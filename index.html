    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Walt Disney's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1901</strong> - Walt Disney was born to Elias and Flora Disney in Chicago.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1910</strong> - When Walt was a child, the Disney family relocated to a farm. He loved to draw and imagine, but when his father became ill, they had to leave the farm and relocate to Kansas City, Missouri.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1911</strong> - Walt got a paper route while residing in Missouri to help support the family financially. He first discovered movies and fell in love with them while working at this job.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1917</strong> - Walt proceeded drawing, and when his family returned to Chicago he enlisted within the Chicago Foundation of Fine Expressions. It was his dream to work as a daily paper cartoonist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1918</strong> - In spite of the fact that he was too young to join the army, Walt lied around his age in order to enroll. He battled in France for a year within the American Ambulance Corps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1920 - 1923</strong> - Walt joined forces with Ub Iwerks and formed a commercial craftsman company. However, the company fell after only a month. Over a number of years, Walt attempted a few different wanders which failed, including the Laugh-O-gram Organization. He eventually established Disney Brothers Studio in Hollywood, which would afterward become Hyperion Studio.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1928</strong> - Walt produced "Steamboat Willie" during the height of the talking-picture revolution. It was an instant smash since it featured a talking mouse named Mickey.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1930</strong> - 
        Walt and his brother Roy planned to capitalize on Mickey's increasing popularity. They launched a merchandise line and the Mickey Mouse Club, which grew to over one million members in no time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1937</strong> - After making a few "short" movies, Walt chose to move ahead with full-length movies. Snow White and the Seven Midgets was released.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1942</strong> - After Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Walt Disney released multiple films including Fantasia, Pinocchio, and Dumbo. Even though the US Army took over part of the studio to house troops when WWII broke out, Disney was still able to film Bambi.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1950</strong> - Disney released Cinderella, and it was a moment hit. It was their greatest success since the discharge of Snow White.
